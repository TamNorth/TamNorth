## My background

- 👩‍🎓 Natural Sciences graduate from the University of Cambridge
- 🪐 Planetary science researcher, and published author in meteoritics
- 🌍 Manager of the [Professionals Climate Charter](https://professionalsclimatecharter.org/) at E3G

## What I'm working on

Working my way through (and really enjoying!) [Bruno Simon's Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/), so I can bring 3D and animation to the front-end, and also make nifty games in my free time.

I'm also just starting work on my portfolio site, which you can find within this repository. I'll be using this project to learn TypeScript and consolidate my Three.js learning.

## And by night...

- 🛹 I'm a beginner skateboarder - now working on my shuvits
- 🎲 I run TTRPGs - currently Slugblaster, with Shadowdark in the pipeline
- 🍲 I love helping out at my local community kitchen
- 🧗‍♀️ I also climb outdoors and ski, when I get time!
